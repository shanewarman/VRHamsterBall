# VRHamsterBall
The worlds best VR game.


Requires unity to run.


Yeah thats it.


Movement is binded to the triggers, your hands moving in a rolling motion with control how the ball moves. Well thats what we want to achieve anyway.


The game will be level based amd have different level types like puzzles and "Cat Chase" levels. The puzzles will vary depending on the environment that the level is in.


The whole game is mainly based inside a normal suburban house.


There is no reset button currently, just restart the scene
